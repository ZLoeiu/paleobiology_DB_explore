# paleobiology_DB_explore
The goal of this project is to conduct exploratory analysis on data gathered from the Paleobiology Database and to act as a tutorial in the process of data cleaning. In particular, we are examining plant and dinosaur fossils and their spatial relationship as determined by geographic distance. This notebook was written by Zoe Liu and was edited and overseen by Ciera Martinez.
